# Default python environment is python 2, thus python-pip and virtualenv
# python-numpy, python-dev, and python-wheel all needed for TensorFlow build
# git is needed to clone tensorflow repository
# unzip and wget are needed for installing bazel
# sudo is required for installing the TF wheel into /usr/local/...
# zlib1g, zlib1g-dev and bash-completion are required by bazel install
# zip and golang-go are needed to run TensorFlow tests
# curl and locate are needed by Tensorflow's configure command
# enum appears to be used in the TensorFlow build
# clang-format-3.9 is needed for code-style checks
# python3-pil is needed to run the inception-resnet-v2 model
# python3-tk is used by matplotlib (pip installed below)
# libsdl1.2-dev is needed to run the A3C model

# The "locate" command uses a prepopulated index.  If this index is not built,
# then "locate" will find absolutely nothing.  In Tensorflow's configure,
# this manifests itself as a silent failure of the configure script to run to
# completion.  Therefore, updatedb MUST BE RUN to provide an index for "locate".

# We need to be careful to run apt-get update in any RUN where apt-get install

# Copy in the run-as-user.sh script
# This will allow the builds, which are done in a mounted directory, to
# be run as the user who runs "docker run".  This then allows the mounted
# directory to be properly deleted by the user later (e.g. by jenkins).
