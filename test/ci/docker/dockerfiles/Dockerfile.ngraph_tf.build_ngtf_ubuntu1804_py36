# Environment to build and unit-test ngraph-tensorflow-bridge

FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Default python environment is python 3, thus python3-pip and virtualenv
# Default gcc 7.3 for ubuntu 18.04
# python3-dev is needed for TensorFlow build
# git is needed to clone tensorflow repository
# unzip and wget are needed for installing bazel
# sudo is required for installing the TF wheel into /usr/local/...
# zlib1g, zlib1g-dev and bash-completion are required by bazel install
# zip and golang-go are needed to run TensorFlow tests
# curl and locate are needed by Tensorflow's configure command
# clang-format-3.9 is needed for code-style checks

# Report which gcc and g++ versions are present
RUN which gcc && gcc --version || true
RUN which c++ && c++ --version || true

# The "locate" command uses a prepopulated index.  If this index is not built,
# then "locate" will find absolutely nothing.  In Tensorflow's configure,
# this manifests itself as a silent failure of the configure script to run to
# completion.  Therefore, updatedb MUST BE RUN to provide an index for "locate".
RUN updatedb

# The pip-upgrade for pip, setuptools, and virtualenv is to avoid a nasty
#   bug in setuptools: "_NamespacePath object has no attribute sort"
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv==16.1.0

# We include pytest so the Docker image can be used for daily validation
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pytest

# We include openjdk-8-jdk
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk

# This bazel version works with current TF
RUN wget --no-verbose -c https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.21.0/bazel_0.21.0-linux-x86_64.deb
RUN dpkg -i bazel_0.21.0-linux-x86_64.deb || true

# Copy in the run-as-user.sh script
# This will allow the builds, which are done in a mounted directory, to
# be run as the user who runs "docker run".  This then allows the mounted
# directory to be properly deleted by the user later (e.g. by jenkins).
