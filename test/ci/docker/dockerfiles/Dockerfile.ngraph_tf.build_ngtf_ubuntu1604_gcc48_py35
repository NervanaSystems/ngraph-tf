# Environment to build and unit-test ngraph-tensorflow-bridge

# Default python environment is python 3, thus python3-pip and virtualenv
# python3-dev is needed for TensorFlow build
# git is needed to clone tensorflow repository
# unzip and wget are needed for installing bazel
# sudo is required for installing the TF wheel into /usr/local/...
# zlib1g, zlib1g-dev and bash-completion are required by bazel install
# zip and golang-go are needed to run TensorFlow tests
# curl and locate are needed by Tensorflow's configure command
# clang-format-3.9 is needed for code-style checks

# The "locate" command uses a prepopulated index.  If this index is not built,
