# Intel® nGraph™ Compiler and runtime for TensorFlow*

This repository contains the code needed to enable Intel® nGraph™ Compiler and 
runtime engine for TensorFlow. Use it to speed up your TensorFlow training and 
inference workloads. The nGraph Library and runtime suite can also be used to 
customize and deploy Deep Learning inference models that will "just work" with 
a variety of nGraph-enabled backends: CPU, GPU, and custom silicon like the 
[Intel® Nervana™ NNP](https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/inteldcisummit-artificial-intelligence/).

## Linux instructions


### Option 1: Use an existing TensorFlow installation

1. You need to instantiate a specific kind of `virtualenv`  to 
   be able to proceed with the `ngraph-tf` bridge installation. For 
   systems with Python 3.n or Python 2.7, these commands are

        virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 your_virtualenv 
        virtualenv --system-site-packages -p /usr/bin/python2 your_virtualenv  
        source your_virtualenv/bin/activate # bash, sh, ksh, or zsh
    
2. Install TensorFlow v1.12.0-rc1. Note that this is a pre-release so you need 
   to use the following steps to install this:

        pip install tensorflow==1.12.0rc1
   Note: When TensorFlow release version `v1.12.0` is available, 
   update your version of TensorFlow using the following command:

        pip install -U tensorflow

3. Checkout `v0.7.0-rc0` from the `ngraph-tf` repo and build the bridge
   as follows: 
   
        git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph-tf.git
        cd ngraph-tf
        git checkout v0.7.0-rc0
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j <number_of_processor_cores_on_system>
        make install 
        pip install -U python/dist/ngraph-0.7.0-py2.py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl


### Option 2: Build nGraph bridge from source using TensorFlow source

To run unit tests, or if you are planning to contribute, install the nGraph 
bridge using the TensorFlow source tree as follows: 

#### Prepare the build environment

The installation prerequisites are the same as described in the TensorFlow 
[prepare environment] for linux.

1. We use the standard build process which is a system called "bazel". These 
   instructions were tested with [bazel version 0.16.0]. 

        wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.16.0/bazel-0.16.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh      
        chmod +x bazel-0.16.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
        ./bazel-0.16.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user

2. Add and source the ``bin`` path to your ``~/.bashrc`` file in order to be 
   able to call bazel from the user's installation we set up:

        export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
        source ~/.bashrc   

#### Installation

1. Once TensorFlow's dependencies are installed, clone the source of the 
   [tensorflow] repo to your machine. 

     :warning: You need the following version of TensorFlow: `v1.12.0-rc1`

        git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
        cd tensorflow
        git checkout v1.12.0-rc1
        git status
        HEAD detached at v1.12.0-rc1
   
2. You must instantiate a specific kind of `virtualenv`  to be able to proceed 
   with the `ngraph-tf` bridge installation. For systems with Python 3.n or 
   Python 2.7, these commands are

        virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 your_virtualenv 
        virtualenv --system-site-packages -p /usr/bin/python2 your_virtualenv  
        source your_virtualenv/bin/activate # bash, sh, ksh, or zsh
        
   Note: Depending on specific version of the Python and components already
   installed on your system - the list of dependent Python components vary. 
   You may need to install one or more of the following Python packages: `numpy mock keras keras_applications protobuf keras_preprocessing`.
   
3. Now run `./configure` and choose `no` for the following when prompted to build TensorFlow.

    XLA support:

        Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [Y/n]: n
        No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

    CUDA support:
    
        Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: N
        No CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.
    
    Note that if you are running TensorFlow on a Skylake family processor then select
    `-march=broadwell` when prompted to specify the optimization flags:
    
        Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation 
        when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified 
        [Default is -march=native]: -march=broadwell
    
    This is due to an issue in TensorFlow which is being actively worked on: 
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17273

4. Prepare the pip package and the TensorFlow C++ library:

        bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
        bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package ./

5. Install the pip package, replacing the `tensorflow-1.*` with your 
   version of TensorFlow:

        pip install -U ./tensorflow-1.*whl
   
6. Now clone the `ngraph-tf` repo one level above -- in the 
  *parent* directory of the `tensorflow` repo cloned in step 1:

        cd ..
        git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph-tf.git
        cd ngraph-tf
        git checkout v0.7.0


7. Next, build and install nGraph bridge. 
   :warning: Run the ngraph-tf build from within the `virtualenv`.

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DUNIT_TEST_ENABLE=TRUE -DTF_SRC_DIR=<path to TensorFlow source directory> ..
        make -j <your_processor_cores>
        make install 
        pip install -U python/dist/<ngraph-0.7.0-py2.py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl>

This final step automatically downloads the necessary version of `ngraph` and 
the dependencies.

Once the build and installation steps are complete, you can start using TensorFlow 
with nGraph backends. 

Please add the following line to enable nGraph: `import ngraph`

Note: The actual filename for the pip package may be different as it's version 
dependent. Please check the `build/python/dist` directory for the actual pip wheel.

## Using the upstreamed version

nGraph is being added to the TensorFlow source tree the using pull requests from 
time to time. 

In order to build that version of nGraph, download the source tree as mentioned
above and use the following option for building with nGraph:

        cd tensorflow
        git checkout v1.12.0-rc1
        bazel build --config=opt --config=mkl --config=ngraph //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package 

For this final option, there is **no need to separately build `ngraph-tf` or to 
use `pip` to install the ngraph module**. With this configuration, your TensorFlow 
model scripts will work without any changes. 

Note: The version that is available in the upstreamed version of TensorFlow usually
lags the features and bug fixes available in the `master` branch of this repository.

### Running tests

To run the C++ unit tests,

* Go to the build directory and run the following commands:

    cd test
    ./gtest_ngtf

You can run a few of your own DL models to validate the end-to-end 
functionality. Also, you can use the `ngraph-tf/examples` directory and try to 
run the following model with some MNIST data on your local machine: 

        cd examples/mnist
        python mnist_fprop_only.py --data_dir <input_data_location> 

## Using OS X 

The build and installation instructions are idential for Ubuntu 16.04 and OS X. 

### Running tests

Export the appropriate paths to your build location; OS X uses the `DYLD_` prefix:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/bazel-out/darwin-py3-opt/bin/tensorflow:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/build/ngraph/ngraph_dist/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Then follow "Running tests" on Linux as described above.
